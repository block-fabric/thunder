# Thunder

Thunder is a sidechain of Chains for volume: blocks of up to 32 million weight units, eight times the
block size of Bitcoin, so that the mainchain can stay small. Its coins are CHN, deposited from the
mainchain and withdrawn back to it.

| | |
|---|---|
| Slot on the mainchain | 2 |
| Coin | CHN, deposited from [Chains](https://github.com/block-fabric/chains) and withdrawn back to it |
| Addresses | `th1…` (`tth1…` on the test networks) |
| P2P port | 9755 (testnet 19755, signet 39755, regtest 29755) |
| RPC port | 9754 (testnet 19754, signet 39754, regtest 29754) |

Thunder is the [sidechain template](doc/sidechain.md) of Chains with its own identity and a larger block. A Thunder node needs a
Chains node (`chainsd` or `chains-qt`) to follow, reached over its RPC interface.

## Installing

Builds for Linux (x86-64) are at https://blockfab.org/drivechains/. Unpack, check `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`, and run what is in `bin/`. The wallet needs the Qt libraries of the system (on Ubuntu 24.04: `sudo apt install libqt6widgets6 libqt6network6 libqt6dbus6 libqrencode4 libsqlite3-0`); the node and the tools need none of them.

## Building from source

On Debian or Ubuntu (24.04):

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkgconf python3 libevent-dev libboost-dev \
    libsqlite3-dev libzmq3-dev qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev qt6-l10n-tools libqrencode-dev
git clone https://github.com/block-fabric/thunder.git
cd thunder
cmake -B build -DBUILD_GUI=ON
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

Leave out `-DBUILD_GUI=ON` (and the Qt packages) for a node without a window. Other systems and
options: [doc/build-unix.md](doc/build-unix.md) and the other `doc/build-*.md`.

The programs, in `build/bin`:

| Program | What it is |
|---|---|
| `thunder-qt` | the wallet, with its window |
| `thunderd` | the node, without a window |
| `thunder-cli` | commands for a running node or wallet |
| `thunder-wallet`, `thunder-tx`, `thunder-util` | tools that work without a node |

Tests: `ctest --test-dir build` (unit tests) and `build/test/functional/test_runner.py`. The
sidechain tests need a built Chains tree next to this one (`../chains`), or `MAINCHAIN_BIN_DIR`
set to the folder of its programs.

## Running it

First a Chains node, with RPC on (`server=1` in `chains.conf`, or `-server`), on the same network.

The simplest is to let the Chains wallet run Thunder: in its **Sidechain Nodes** window, select
Thunder, press **Locate programs…** and choose the folder with `thunderd` and `thunder-qt`, then **Start node**
or **Open wallet**.

By hand, on the same computer as the Chains node:

```sh
thunder-qt                 # the main network
thunder-qt -testnet        # the test network
```

It finds the Chains node by itself: RPC on 127.0.0.1 at the port of the network, and the cookie
file in the Chains data folder (`~/.chains/.cookie`, `~/.chains/testnet/.cookie`). Options for
anything else:

| Option | What it is |
|---|---|
| `-mainchainrpcconnect=<ip>` | address of the Chains node (default 127.0.0.1) |
| `-mainchainrpcport=<port>` | its RPC port (default 9554, testnet 19554, signet 39554, regtest 29554) |
| `-mainchainrpccookiefile=<file>` | its cookie file |
| `-mainchaindatadir=<dir>` | its data folder, where the cookie file is looked for (default `~/.chains`) |
| `-mainchainrpcuser=<user>`, `-mainchainrpcpassword=<pw>` | credentials, instead of the cookie |
| `-mainchainrpcwallet=<name>` | the Chains wallet that pays for merged mining (default: its only loaded wallet) |

The slot is fixed on the main and test networks; `-sidechainslot=<n>` is for regtest only, where
it makes the chain a sidechain in slot `n` (see [doc/sidechain.md](doc/sidechain.md)).

Data and the configuration file `thunder.conf` are in `~/.thunder`; the test network has a subfolder
`testnet`. The networks have no DNS seeds: give the node a peer with `addnode`. A sample
`~/.thunder/thunder.conf`:

```ini
server=1
fallbackfee=0.0002

# For the test network instead, uncomment:
# testnet=1

[main]
addnode=<peer>:9755
mainchainrpcwallet=<wallet of the Chains node>

[test]
addnode=<peer>:19755
mainchainrpcwallet=<wallet of the Chains node>
```

On the test network, the `-mainchainrpcport`, `-mainchainrpccookiefile` and `-mainchainrpcwallet`
options are read only from the `[test]` section.

## Coins in and out

- **Deposit.** In Thunder, get a deposit address (`getdepositaddress`, or the **Mainchain** page):
  `s2_<address>_<checksum>`. In Chains, send to it from the **Sidechains** page, or
  `chains-cli createsidechaindeposit 2 <deposit address> <amount>`. The coins appear with the
  next Thunder block.
- **Withdraw.** `createwithdrawal <Chains address> <amount> ( <fee for Chains miners> )`, or the
  **Mainchain** page. Withdrawals are paid in bundles that Chains miners vote on (about three
  months on the main network, 600 blocks on the test network). A withdrawal not in the bundle
  being voted on can be taken back: `refundwithdrawal <txid> <vout>`.
- **Merged mining.** Thunder blocks are mined by Chains miners, for a fee in CHN paid by the Chains
  wallet. `setbmm true <Thunder address>` has the node ask for a block whenever the fees waiting pay
  for one; it offers the miners 99% and keeps 1% at the address. `requestbmmblock <address>
  <amount>` asks for one block now, for a fee of your choice (for a deposit on a quiet chain).
  `getbmminfo` shows how it goes.

How deposits, withdrawals, bundles and merged mining work: [doc/sidechain.md](doc/sidechain.md).

## What it is for

Payments: Thunder is the template with large blocks and nothing else, so it is the place for
many transactions at low fees. Everything a Bitcoin Core wallet does, it does.

## Commands

The commands of Bitcoin Core, and those of every sidechain:

Sidechain, on the node: `getmainchaininfo`, `syncmainchain`, `setbmm`, `getbmminfo`, `requestbmmblock`, `createbmmblock`, `listwithdrawals`, `getwithdrawalbundle`.

Sidechain, in the wallet: `getdepositaddress`, `createwithdrawal`, `refundwithdrawal`.

## Wallet

The pages: Overview, Send, Receive, Transactions, **Mainchain** (deposits, withdrawals, merged
mining).

## Credits

Thunder is inspired by **Thunder by LayerTwo Labs**, a sidechain with large blocks. It is built on the sidechain template of Chains, which is based on
[Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) v32; its README is in
[doc/README-bitcoin-core.md](doc/README-bitcoin-core.md).
