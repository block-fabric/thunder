/**
 * The rules that make this chain a sidechain.
 *
 * Coins enter the chain when the mainchain records a deposit to it, and leave
 * it when the mainchain pays out a withdrawal bundle:
 *
 *  - Blind merged mining. A block is valid only if a mainchain block committed
 *    to its hash. A block follows the mainchain up to the block before the one
 *    that committed to it, and has to act on everything the mainchain did for
 *    this sidechain since its parent block.
 *  - Deposits. The coinbase pays every deposit the mainchain recorded to the
 *    destination the depositor named.
 *  - Withdrawals. A transaction burns coins in a withdrawal output, which
 *    names a mainchain destination and a fee for mainchain miners.
 *  - Bundles. A block may commit to a withdrawal bundle: the mainchain
 *    transaction that pays the waiting withdrawals. Which withdrawals go in a
 *    bundle is fixed by the rules, so every node builds the same one. There is
 *    at most one bundle at a time; the mainchain votes on it, then pays it or
 *    lets it fail, and a block acts on that outcome.
 *  - Refunds. Whoever made a withdrawal can take it back while it is not in a
 *    bundle; the coinbase of the block with the request pays the coins back.
